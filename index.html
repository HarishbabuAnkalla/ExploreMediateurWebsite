                    Many thanks for all your efforts you put in processing my visa application. Although, I can’t express my gratitude in words, I tried to pen down my experience with ImmigrationXperts in my testimonial below.
                    “I received the Australian visa grant today – Skilled – Independent (subclass 189). It is like a dream come true. Had I not visited ImmigrationXperts and met Mr. Manish Srivastava, this would have not been possible. After been deceived and dejected by many renowned visa consultants in Delhi, I was about to lose hope to migrate to Australia. Luckily, I saw Immigration Experts while googling for other Australian PR consultants. I thought to give a try.

            <p class="description">The Australian Regional Occupation List (ROL) consists of a total of 77 occupations that are in high demand especially in the regional areas of Australia.</p>
            <p class="description">The Department of Home Affairs (DOH) recently introduced a new list (LIN 19/050) relevant for the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme visa (RSMS) which became effective from March 2019 onwards.</p>
            <p class="description">The main aim of introducing this particular list as one of the important Skilled Occupation List was to address the needs of regional parts of Australia and introduce more labor in these areas. Further, this list is valid only for some of the key skilled visa programs and is therefore needed by the applicants who are applying under the following visa categories:</p>
            <p class="description">1. Training visa (Subclass 407)</p>
            <p class="description">2. Skilled Regional (Provincial) visa (Subclass 489)</p>
            <p class="description">3. Temporary Skills Shortage visa (Subclass 482)</p>
            <p class="description">All these visa categories specifically deal with regional visa programs. Also, the Regional Occupation List is exclusively applicable for those applicants who have been sponsored or nominated by the Australian State or Territory Government agency and are issued an invitation to apply (ITA) either on or after 18 March 2019 under the above-mentioned visa categories.</p>
            <p class="description">The Department of Home Affairs regularly updates the Regional Occupation List (ROL) as per the changes in the conditions of Australian labor market. The Department of Employment, Skills, Small and Family Business (formerly known as the Department of Jobs and Small Business) is mainly responsible for reviewing the Regional Occupation List (ROL) under the given visa categories.</p>

            <p class="description">The Department of Employment (DOE) along with the Department of Home Affairs (DOH) has recently included a total of 59 new occupations within the Regional Occupation List (ROL) specifically for the Skilled Regional (Provisional) visa (Subclass 489).</p>
            <p class="description">
                Since, Skilled Regional (Provisional) visa (Subclass 489) is one of the most sort-after visa categories for getting the permanent residency (PR) to Australia, this particular inclusion of an additional number of occupations in the Regional Occupation List (ROL) is a positive step.
            </p>
            <p class="description">Moreover, some of the occupations that were removed previously from the Australia Skilled Occupation List are added again through the Regional Occupation List (ROL) under the Skilled Regional (Provincial) visa (Subclass 489).</p>

            <p class="description">
                The selection to the subclass 189 is dependent on point score, skills, as well as experience that allow an applicant to apply for visa 189. Though, to be entitled to apply for this visa you will first of all have to select a profession from MLTSSL (Medium and Long Term Strategic Skill List). In case the occupation chosen by you is not found on the demand list, then under such a circumstance, you may pick an occupation which is very much linked to your profession. Furthermore, you likewise need to submit Australia EOI through Skills select for approval of your visa. You may apply for EOI while living in or outside Australia. In case government of Australia observes your profile to be appropriate enough for their economy, they will provide you with an Invitation To Apply (ITA) for Australia Permanent Residency.

            <p class="description">16 November 2019 Significant modifications to the qualified migration program were announced by the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Three fresh subclasses of visas will also be implemented when some current subclasses of visas are closed. These fresh visas are called’ New Skilled Regional Visas’ collectively. We will look at one of these visas-which would benefit visa applicants who have either been unable to obtain Subclass 189/190 invites or have families residing in Australia’s regional fields. The visa will be implemented in order to improve the intake of migrants into regional fields. It is designed that any region excluding major towns such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Gold Coast, and Perth be designated as a regional region at the beginning of November 16, 2019. In addition, the visa holder would be permitted to reside in any specified regional region and move between regional regions as well. The Regional (Provisional) Visa for Subclass 491 Skilled Work-is a temporary visa and is awarded for 5 years. After three years, visa holders will be eligible for a permanent residence visa. Applicants for this visa must be nominated by a government agency of the Australian state or territory or sponsored by an eligible family member living in a specified regional region and be invited to apply for a visa after submitting an expression of interest (EOI).</p>

            <p class="description">Overall, these modifications in the 491 visa seem to give enhanced possibilities in regional Australia for qualified migrants. In the past, however, assurances of priority processing and a higher number of qualified occupations were only characteristic features of regional migration programs to have been gradually removed.</p>
            <p class="description">For fresh visa holders, this greatest negative is a longer wait for permanent residency. If you are eligible for the present subclass 489 visa, you should consider applying now as you will have to wait for an additional year before you are eligible for permanent residency. Unless you’re waiting to become qualified for your nominated job or want to settle.</p>

            <p class="description">The ACT Occupation List defines the abilities presently in demand in Canberra (for skilled migration purposes). The ACT Occupancy List is used to determine the eligibility of the following programs for ACT assistance: 1. ACT Skilled Nominated (subclass 190) Visa appointment. By finishing the Canberra Matrix, you can express interest in the nomination of ACT 190 even if the nominated occupation is closed. However, in the nominated occupation category, only open occupations will help you to earn points. 2. Regional Certifying Body support of an Employer Nomination under the Regional Sponsored Migration Scheme. The ACT Occupancy List is not associated with particular work vacancies and is not a work guarantee in a nominated job. Before applying for an ACT nomination, you must be satisfied that there are enough job opportunities in your nominated occupation. As part of a standard selection process, you will compete for job vacancies with all individuals on the labor market. While a significant assessment of occupational demand will usually be carried out twice a year (in February and August), the demand for each occupation will be continuously evaluated. The occupation will be closed without further notice once it is determined that the demand for an occupation has been met.</p>

                <h1 class="immigration-heading">
                    If your occupation is closed, you cannot claim Canberra Matrix points in the ‘Nominated Occupation’ category.
